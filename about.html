<p>I'm a 25 year old living in the city of Chicago. I'm passionate about traveling to new places, watching Notre Dame football with my best friends, and golfing whenever I get the chance. I'm incredibly excited to learn how to program. Just like learning a new spoken language, I've always been fascinated by the idea and am excited to learn how to turn my ideas into reality through power of computer programming.</p>
