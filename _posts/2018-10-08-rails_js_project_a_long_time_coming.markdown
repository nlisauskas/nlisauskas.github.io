I'll admit it - I struggled at times during this project. When I began this project I was a management consultant (back in late April). Now, I've finally (close to) finished, and I have an entirely different career path and am working for a new company. I promised myself I would go through with the Flatiron School though because of how much time, money, and energy I've invested to date. I still have dreams of building my own online business and I believe the skills I've learned and am continuing to learn are invaluable for that reason.

Now that I'm slowly getting back into the habit of coding on a regular basis again, I've remembered how much I love learning to code. Getting into the swing of things with this project was an awesome feeling. It took a decent amount of energy to re-learn some concepts I'd previously felt I already mastered. Re-watching some of the lesson videos was also an energy drainer, but at the same time it was a great feeling to see my JSON based form displaying and submitting properly. I'm excited to move forward with building this into a more usable application once I've graduated from the Flatiron School. One thing that I'd love to work on in my project review session is how to incorporate templates into my project. I struggle to understand them when using the Flatiron lessons so would love the 1 on 1 instruction there.
